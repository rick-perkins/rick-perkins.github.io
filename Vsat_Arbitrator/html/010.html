			Serial connections between the MXP/ DAC’s and arbitrator:
				<ul><li>These two connections must be used at all times.</li>
					<li>These are used to switch the arbitrator when the one of the systems in a blockage zone, or in an error state.</li>
					<li>When the modem is using serial connection (non openAMIP setup) the GPS is sent to the modem via the arbitrator on these cables.</li>
				</ul>
			Serial connection to the modem console port (Idirect modem non openAMIP) or to Comtech modem:<br>
			This cable is used for the following:
				<ul><li>To send serial GPS to the modem from the active system.</li>	
					<li>TX mute to the modem from the arbitrator (the arbitrator controls the TX mute).</li>
					<li>RX lock from the modem to the arbitrator which passes this on to both antennas.</li>
				</ul>
			OpenAMIP setup:
				<ul><li>All the openAMIP commands are sent to the arbitrator , the arbitrator will forward the commands to both systems.</li>
					<li>OpenAMIP commands from the active system only will be passed to the modem, when the arbitrator switches the commands from the second system will then be passed to the modem.</li>
				</ul>
			Arbitrator not switching:
				<ul><li>Make sure both serial connections are installed between the arbitrator and the MXP/DAC’s.</li>
					<li>Make sure the serial connections are not reversed I.E. antenna A is connected to Antenna A on the arbitrator.</li>
					<li>The non-active system is not in a blocked or error state.</li>
					<li>The MXP/DAC’s are set to blockage high state.</li>
					<li>DAC must have 16 in the system type no matter what modem is used.</li>
					<li>MXP must have the Block output set to high no matter what modem is being used.</li>
				</ul>
			Antennas keeps retargeting or modem lock not working:
				<ul><li>Idirect modem when using openAMIP must have TX handshaking enabled.</li> 
					<li>Comtech modem make sure voltage is added to the RX lock pin if needed.</li>
					<li>DAC must have 2 added to the system type.</li>
					<li>MXP must have lock enabled under the modem settings on the interface page.</li>
					<li>MXP must have the modem I/O set to openAMIP with an openAMIP setup.</li>
					<li>DAC may need 128 added to the system to reverse the modem input logic when not using openAMIP.</li>
					<li>MXP may need the Lock input changing or the sense voltage reducing when not using openAMIP.</li>
				</ul>
