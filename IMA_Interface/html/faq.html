<div id='ans' name='ans'><p>
  Signal Bar represents visually relative signal strength (AGC). The more green bars, the stronger the signal strength. One brown bar that represents threshold will show up all the time.<p> 
  If AGC is 300 counts less than threshold, all bars are in gray.<p>
  If signal strength is below the threshold, red bars show up. Red bars indicate the AGC levels. <p>
  If signal strength (AGC) is greater than threshold, green bars appear.  If AGC is 300 counts greater than threshold, all bars are in green.<p>
  AGC values are displayed in upper_left corner of the signal bar.

<div id='ans' name='ans'><p>

1. Microsoft Internet Explorer and Google Chrome
<P>
Internet Explorer uses a system-wide store for certificates. Import a new certificate into the Trusted Root Certification Authority store with the following procedure:

<ul>
<li>Select Tools/Internet Options from the menu.
<li>From the Content tab, choose Certificates.
<li>Clicking Trusted Root Certification Authorities tab.

2 Mozilla Firefox
<P>
Mozilla Firefox does not use a system-wide certificate store like Microsoft Internet Explorer and other applications. Create an exception that allows Mozilla Firefox to use the new certificate.
Note: The target must be running and functioning properly for this procedure – Mozilla queries the server, acquires the certificate, and installs the exception with the following:

<ul>
<li>Select Tools/Options from the menu.
<li>Choose the Advanced panel.
<li>From the Encryption tab, choose View Certificates.
<li>From the Servers tab, choose Add Exception…
<li>In the Location, enter the server address (https://10.1.1.100 for the ssldemo demonstration).

<a href="#" id="toggleDiv" class='linkblacklarge'>13. How to get signed SSL Certificate?</a>
<div id='ans' name='ans'><p>
	
	There are two ways listed below to get signed SSL Certificates.
	Just keep in mind that seatel_key.pem and seatel_cert.pem will be the key and certificate file names that allow the certificate to be enabled by the web server.
	<p>
	
	1. Create self_signed SSL Certificates<p>
	
	Self_signed SSL Certificates is suited to small, static installations like MXP web. 
	It is also interesting to know that some people feel that self-signed certificates offer a greater level of trust than those from Certificate Authorities<p>
	
	Using the OpenSSL command:<br>

    openssl req -config c:/openssl/bin/openssl.cnf -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:512 -keyout seatel
_key.pem -out seatel_cert.pem

<p>
Note: 
     <ul>
     <li> c:/openssl is the folder where OpenSSL is installed.<br>
     <li> for the Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []: prompt, use the server IP address or hostname (i.e. 10.1.1.100 or www.server_name.com). 
	 <li> Certificates loaded to web Server must include an RSA public key
	 <li> web server support RSA public key with size of 512k or 1024k
	 <li> web server supports SHA-1
	 <li> web server does not support client authentication. Instead web server authenticates the server
	 <li> web server does not support certificate chains; it only responds to client connection requests 
	 </ul>
<p>

    2. Create SSL Certificates and have it signed by a trusted certificate authority<p>
	
	You can obtain a certificate by sending a certificate request including subject (aka common name) and public key fields 
	to a trusted certificate authority. The certificate authority signs the request with its own private key 
	and sends the fully formed certificate back to be installed on your Web server.<p>
	
	Below are the steps to generate public keys (seatel.key below):
    <p>
	<ul>
    <li>step#1:<p>
        openssl req -config c:/openssl/bin/openssl.cnf -new -out seatel.csr -keyout seatel.pem
        <p>
        Required params:<br>
        PEM pass phrase: "none" or "password"<br>
        Common Name: 10.1.1.100<br>

    <p>
    <li> step#2:<p>
         openssl rsa -in seatel.pem -out seatel.key<p>

         Required param:<br>
         PEM pass phrase: "none" or "password"<br>
   <ul>

<a href="#" id="toggleDiv" class='linkblacklarge'>14. Why do I have trouble loading page when access web via HTTPS?</a>
<div id='ans' name='ans'><p>
When you try to access MXP web by https such as https://10.1.1.100/Login.html, and get a problem loading or displaying page, it is likely that
proper SSL protocol is not enabled. MXP web requires SSL 3.0 be enabled in your browser.<br>
To enable SSL in your browser, see FAQ #10 above: How to enable SSL 3.0?<p>

You may also check to see if you use certificate chains. This webserver does not support certificate chains, it only responds to client connection requests with a single certificate.

<div id='ans' name='ans'><p>
    There is a tool in MXP Web which allows you to upload both certificate and key to web server.<br>
	On left-hand side menu, locate Others, click Admin, then click SSL tab to see the SSL certificate uploading page.
	<p>Make sure that files of key and certificate are in the right names. seatel_key.pem and seatel_cert.pem are the names 
	 accepted internally by the system for key and certificate, respectively.<br>
	<p>Therefore, rename your files if neccessary before uploading.

<a href="#" id="toggleDiv" class='linkblacklarge'>16. What to do when I cannot access login page via either HTTP or HTTPS?</a>
<div id='ans' name='ans'><p>
If you cannot access the login page after you upload the certificate, and the system rebooted, it is likely that
the format of the certificate is incorrect. <br>

In this case, the key and certificate you have just uploaded need to be removed. You can telnet to the server,
then delete both seatel_key.pem and seatel_cert.pem.  Once deletion is complete, reboot the system. Now you should be able to
access the login page.

<div id='ans' name='ans'><p>
  
HyperTerminal is no longer part of Windows. There are several options you can use to replace its functionality. 
<ul>
<li>
If you only need remote shell access, you can use WinRS (Windows Remote Shell), new in Windows Vista. To get help with WinRS, type winrs /? at the command prompt, and then press ENTER.
<p>
Telnet is a simple, text-based program that you can use to connect to another computer over the Internet. 
<p>
<li>
If you previously used HyperTerminal to troubleshoot modem problems, use Phone and Modem Options instead:
<p>
Open Phone and Modem Options by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Hardware and Sound, and then clicking Phone and Modem Options. 
<p>
Note:
<br>
You might need to provide information, such as your country or region and any special phone dialing rules, in the Location Information dialog box before you can access the Phone and Modem Options dialog box.
<p>
<li>
If you previously used HyperTerminal to control serial devices, you can usually find a downloadable version of HyperTerminal on the Internet that is free for personal use.

<div id='ans' name='ans'><p>
There are two ways to export the System log: (a) from Activity->View Activity Log or (b) from Data Export -> System Log.
<p>
When exporting the system activity log using View Activity Log, the data records exported are what you see on the screen.  The maximum number 
of the records shown on screen is limited to 3000, no matter how much data is requested.
<p>
When exported from the System Log, there is no maximum limitation for records number to be exported. This is true for both single file exportation
and exportation from a given time frame.

<div id='ans' name='ans'><p>
If the web worked properly before, and you can still perform all jobs now, but you see the background color or images do not show up, or see abnormal strips in signal bar. In this case, it is likely that one or more files, which were downloaded to your computer to support web pages, corrupted. <p>

To clean up the corrupted files in IE, go to Tools, then Internet options, click General tab, click Delete button under Browser history section, check Temporary Internet files, then click Delete button.
Now, close IE either click X on upper-right corner or click File, click Exit.<p>

Now, launch IE again, once you are logged in, you should see the normal background, images etc.<p>

File corruption on your computer is rare, but it does happen occasionally.<p>
